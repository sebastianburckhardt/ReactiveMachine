# Hello World

The Hello World example serves to verify that you've got the Reactive Machine built correctly and can get a basic service up and running.  Further examples, like the Echo and Counter examples demonstrate features of the programming model.

## Definining a service

We begin by defining a new service: ```HelloWorld.Service``` using the Reactive Machine's service builder definition.  This builder will scan the current DLL and generate a service based on the definitions included.

```c#
namespace HelloWorld.Service
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Provides the building instructions for the hello world service
    /// </summary>
    public class HelloWorldService : ReactiveMachine.IServiceBuildDefinition
    {
        public void Build(IServiceBuilder builder)
        {
            // we build this service by automatically scanning the project for declarations
            builder.ScanThisDLL();
        }
    }
}
```

## Your First Orchestration

We define a single orchestration, the ```HelloWorld``` orchestration that logs a message and returns the string "Hello World!".

```c#
namespace HelloWorld.Service
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Defines an orchestration that runs automatically when the service is started for the first time
    /// </summary>
    public class HelloWorldOrchestration : ReactiveMachine.IOrchestration<string>
    {
        public Task<string> Execute(IOrchestrationContext context)
        {
            context.Logger.LogInformation("Hello World was called");

            return Task.FromResult("Hello World");
        }
    }
}
```

## Test Service

To test our application, we build a test service with a default orchestration that will be executed on startup, called the startup orchestration.  In this orchestration, we iterate a fixed number of times issuing requests to the Hello World service.

Here's the service definition for our test service.

```c#
namespace HelloWorld.Test
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Provides the building instructions for the hello world service
    /// </summary>
    public class HelloWorldTestService : ReactiveMachine.IServiceBuildDefinition
    {
        public void Build(IServiceBuilder builder)
        {
            // first we import the HelloWorld service
            builder.BuildService<HelloWorldService>();

            // we build this service by automatically scanning the project for declarations
            builder.ScanThisDLL();
        }
    }
}
```

Here's the startup orchestration.

```c#
namespace HelloWorld.Test
{
    /// <summary>
    /// An orchestration that tests the hello world service,
    /// and runs automatically when the service is started for the first time
    /// </summary>
    public class HelloWorldTestOrchestration : ReactiveMachine.IStartupOrchestration
    {
        public async Task<UnitType> Execute(IOrchestrationContext context)
        {
            var config = context.GetConfiguration<HelloWorldTestConfiguration>() 
                ?? new HelloWorldTestConfiguration();

            for (int i = 0; i < config.NumberRepetitions; i++)
                await context.PerformOrchestration(new HelloWorldOrchestration());

            return UnitType.Value;
        }
    }
}
```
