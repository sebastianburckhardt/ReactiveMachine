- title: Author microservices without thinking about faults or servers.
  description: It's about the application logic, not the execution platform.
- title: Deploy on your back-end of choice.
  description: Keep your options open. For example, host on serverless functions with a consumption plan. Or run your own elastic K8s cluster. And of course, debug on your local emulator first.
- title: Orchestrations and actors and events, oh my.
  description: We put it all together in an intuitive task-oriented programming model. Write orchestrations using async/await, encapsulate state in virtual actors, and subscribe them to **globally ordered atomic events**. 
- title: Always recoverable, always consistent.
  description: The runtime takes care of logging messages and persisting snapshots to durable cloud storage. So that when machines go down or connections fail, it can recover without missing a beat.
